# Maneuver-Based Generation of Motion Primitives for Motion Planning in State Lattices 

This repository contains code for generating a motion primitive set based on a set of user-defined maneuvers. It is implelemented in MATLAB using casADi together with IPOPT. https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions contains information on how to install casADi for MATLAB.

To generate the motion primitives, the file ```main.m``` can be used. There, it is possible to change which parameters that should be used and what maneuvers to generate.
